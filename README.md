# CurrencyConverter
This is a Java application which let you convert from a currency to another in with real-time values

The purpose of this application is an educational one, trying to implement many things and learn new Java related tricks.
In Version 1.0 we have so far:
- a real-time checking of currencies from BNR(Banca Nationala Romana).
- a MVC implementation
- the application is based on JavaFX
- use of Regular Expression.

In Version 1.1 I want to implement things like:
- Implement an offline mode.
- Serializable, to read and write the currencies information for offline usage.
- Adding an reverse currency button(Eg. EUR->USD -> USD->EUR)
- Adding new alerts and use exceptions
